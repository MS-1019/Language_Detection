# Language_Detection
A language detection project focuses on identifying the natural language of a given text......ðŸ™ƒ

For Text-Based Language Detection:
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
<br>
Gather a dataset containing text samples labeled with their respective languages.
Preprocess the text by converting it to lowercase, removing special characters, punctuation, and potentially stop words.
<br>
Feature Extraction:
<br>
Transform the cleaned text into numerical representations. Common methods include:
N-grams: Sequences of n consecutive words or characters.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus.
Word Embeddings: Dense vector representations of words capturing semantic meaning.
<br>
Model Selection and Training:
<br>
Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm for text classification, such as:
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier commonly used for text.
<br>
Train the chosen model on the prepared dataset
